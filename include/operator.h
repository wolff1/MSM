void compute_B(short degree)
where
	degree is the max degree of the operator in s^2 and
	B is the blurring operator.

To calculate blurring operator, B_p:
c_n = 1/a_0 (b_n - [a_1*c_{n-1} + a_2*c_{n-2} + ... + a_n*c_0])

NOTE:
	* we do not need to store b at all
	* factorials are not calculated anew in every iteration of the loops
		* f keeps a running product that is equivalent to factorial()
	* inner loop only touches columns which will change for given n,k
		* inner loop could be parallelized, although probably not worth it
	* for more details, go to
